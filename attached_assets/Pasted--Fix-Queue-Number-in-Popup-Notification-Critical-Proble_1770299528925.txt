# Fix Queue Number in Popup Notification

## Critical Problem to Fix

### Issue: Queue Number Mismatch Between Main Card and Popup
**Current Behavior:**
- Main card shows: "Your queue number is #1" ✓ (Correct)
- Bottom-right popup shows: "You are #56 in line" ✗ (WRONG!)
- Customer name: SHRADDHA
- Booking for: 2 people
- Date & Time: 05 Feb, 07:17 PM

**Expected Behavior:**
- Main card shows: "#1" 
- Bottom-right popup should ALSO show: "You are #1 in line"
- Both should display the SAME queue number

## Root Cause
The popup notification is using a different variable or calculation:
- Main card is correctly showing queue position (#1)
- Popup is incorrectly showing booking ID or wrong number (#56)

## Required Fix

### 1. Update Popup Notification
Find the popup/toast notification code (bottom-right corner) that shows:
```
"Welcome to the queue!
You are #56 in line."
```

Change it to use the SAME queue position variable as the main card.

### 2. Ensure Consistency
Both places should use the SAME source for queue number:
- Main card: Shows queue position ✓
- Popup notification: Should show SAME queue position (currently broken)

### 3. Code Location to Check
Look for:
- Toast notification component
- Popup notification component  
- Bottom-right notification display
- The text "Welcome to the queue!" or "You are #[X] in line"

## Implementation Steps

1. **Find popup notification code** (bottom-right corner component)
2. **Locate the variable** showing "#56" 
3. **Replace with** the SAME queue position variable used in main card (currently showing #1 correctly)
4. **Ensure both use same data source** - likely a `queuePosition` or similar variable

## Example Fix Logic
```
// WRONG (current popup code):
notification.text = `You are #${bookingId} in line`  // Shows #56

// CORRECT (should be):
notification.text = `You are #${queuePosition} in line`  // Shows #1
```

## Testing Checklist
After fix, verify:
- [ ] Main card shows queue number (e.g., #1)
- [ ] Popup notification shows SAME queue number (e.g., #1)
- [ ] Both update together if queue position changes
- [ ] No mismatch between main display and popup

## Keep Everything Else As-Is

✅ **DO NOT CHANGE:**
- Queue position calculation on main card (working correctly)
- Recent Activity page functionality
- Confirmation flow
- "I am coming" button
- Leave Queue functionality
- Booking details display
- Date & time display
- Any other features

⚠️ **ONLY FIX:** The queue number shown in the bottom-right popup notification to match the main card's queue number.

## Visual Reference
- Main Card: "#1" ← Correct ✓
- Popup: "#56" ← Needs to show "#1" instead
