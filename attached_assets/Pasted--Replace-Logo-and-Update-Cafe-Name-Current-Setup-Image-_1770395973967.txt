---

## What to Change

### 1. Replace Logo Image

**Current logo file being used:**
Probably named something like: `coffee-cup.png` or `logo.png`

**New logo to use:**
The user will upload the circular badge logo (CAFÉ TWENTY TWENTY - Image 1)
File name will be something like: `cafe-twenty-twenty-logo.png`

**In the code, update the logo source:**

```jsx
// BEFORE (coffee cup logo):
<img src="/logo.png" alt="Made in 2020" />

// AFTER (circular badge logo):
<img src="/cafe-twenty-twenty-logo.png" alt="Cafe Twenty Twenty" />
```

### 2. Update Text Below Logo

**Current text:**
```
"MADE IN 2020"
```

**Change to:**
```
"Cafe Twenty Twenty"
```

**In the code:**
```jsx
// BEFORE:
<h1>MADE IN 2020</h1>

// AFTER:
<h1>Cafe Twenty Twenty</h1>
```

## Where to Make Changes

### Location: Home Page / Booking Form Page

Look for the file: `client/src/pages/Home.tsx` or `client/src/components/Header.tsx`

Find the section with:
1. The logo image
2. The text "MADE IN 2020" or cafe name

### Update Logo Reference

```jsx
{/* Logo Section */}
<div className="flex flex-col items-center mb-6">
  <img 
    src="/cafe-twenty-twenty-logo.png"  {/* ← Update this path */}
    alt="Cafe Twenty Twenty" 
    className="w-32 h-32 mb-3"  {/* Adjust size if needed */}
  />
  <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold text-stone-900">
    Cafe Twenty Twenty  {/* ← Update this text */}
  </h1>
</div>
```

---

## Steps for User

1. **Upload the new logo:**
   - Take Image 1 (CAFÉ TWENTY TWENTY circular badge)
   - Upload to Replit in the `public` folder or `assets` folder
   - Name it something clear like: `cafe-twenty-twenty-logo.png`

2. **Update the code:**
   - Find where current logo is referenced
   - Change the image source to the new logo filename
   - Change text from "MADE IN 2020" to "Cafe Twenty Twenty"

## Logo Sizing (If Needed)

The circular badge logo might need different sizing than the coffee cup:

```jsx
{/* Adjust size based on logo dimensions */}
<img 
  src="/cafe-twenty-twenty-logo.png"
  alt="Cafe Twenty Twenty"
  className="w-40 h-40 object-contain"  {/* Adjust w-40 h-40 as needed */}
/>
```

If logo appears too big or small:
- Increase: `w-48 h-48` or `w-56 h-56`
- Decrease: `w-32 h-32` or `w-24 h-24`

---

## Color Considerations

The circular badge logo (Image 1) is dark/black on transparent or light background.

Make sure the background color matches:
```jsx
<div className="bg-stone-50 p-6 rounded-3xl">  {/* Light background */}
  <img src="/cafe-twenty-twenty-logo.png" alt="Cafe Twenty Twenty" />
</div>
```

---

## Complete Example

```jsx
{/* Header Section with Logo */}
<div className="flex flex-col items-center justify-center py-8 bg-stone-50">
  
  {/* Circular Badge Logo */}
  <img 
    src="/cafe-twenty-twenty-logo.png" 
    alt="Cafe Twenty Twenty"
    className="w-40 h-40 object-contain mb-4"
  />
  
  {/* Cafe Name */}
  <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold text-stone-900 mb-2">
    Cafe Twenty Twenty
  </h1>
  
  {/* Optional tagline */}
  <p className="text-stone-600 text-sm">
    Roasted Rich, Served Rustic
  </p>
  
</div>

{/* Rest of the booking form */}
<div className="p-6">
  <h2>Join the Queue</h2>
  {/* ... form fields ... */}
</div>
```
