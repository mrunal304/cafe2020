I have a restaurant queue management system with MongoDB backend. There's a critical bug where the customer panel shows the wrong queue number.

PROBLEM:
- Customer panel shows queue number #35 (which is the booking ID)
- Admin panel correctly shows the customer at position #4
- Customer should see their ACTUAL current queue position (#4), not the booking ID (#35)

REQUIREMENTS:

1. BACKEND CHANGES (MongoDB + Node.js/Express):
   - Create a function to calculate real-time queue position
   - Count all bookings with status "WAITING" that were created BEFORE the current customer's booking time on the same date
   - Return the actual position number (not booking ID)
   
2. FRONTEND CHANGES (Customer Panel):
   - Replace the booking ID display with actual queue position
   - Show "Your queue number is #4" instead of "#35"
   - Update to fetch and display real-time queue position
   
3. LOGIC TO IMPLEMENT:
   - Queue position = COUNT of (bookings with status="WAITING" AND createdAt < currentBooking.createdAt AND date = currentBooking.date) + 1
   - Recalculate position on every page load/refresh
   - Optional: Add real-time updates when people ahead leave the queue

CURRENT SCHEMA (assumed):
```javascript
Booking {
  _id: ObjectId,
  name: String,
  phone: String,
  numberOfPeople: Number,
  status: String, // "WAITING", "SEATED", "COMPLETED"
  date: Date,
  createdAt: Date,
  // other fields...
}
```

FILES TO UPDATE:
- Backend API route that returns queue information to customer
- Customer panel component that displays queue number
- Any relevant database query functions

EXPECTED RESULT:
- Customer with booking ID #35 should see "Your queue number is #4" because there are only 3 people waiting before them
- Both customer panel and admin panel should show matching queue positions
- Position should update dynamically as people leave the queue

Please fix both backend and frontend code to show the correct current queue position instead of the booking ID.
