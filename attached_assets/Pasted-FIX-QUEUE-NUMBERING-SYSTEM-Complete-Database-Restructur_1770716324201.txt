FIX QUEUE NUMBERING SYSTEM - Complete Database Restructuring Required

CURRENT ISSUES:
1. Queue numbers are incrementing continuously (168, 177, 178) instead of resetting daily
2. Wrong database fields exist (queueNumber, originalQueueNumber)
3. Queue numbers change when customers are finished
4. Daily queue numbering is not working properly

REQUIRED DATABASE SCHEMA:

Booking Model Fields:
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  name: String,
  phoneNumber: String,
  numberOfPeople: Number,
  dailyQueueNumber: Number,      // ONLY queue number field needed
  bookingDate: Date,              // Date only (time set to 00:00:00) for filtering
  bookingDateTime: Date,          // Full timestamp with time
  status: String,                 // "waiting", "called", "confirmed", "completed"
  message: String,
  notificationSent: Boolean,
  calledAt: Date,
  respondedAt: Date,
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}

IMPORTANT: Remove these fields if they exist:
- queueNumber
- originalQueueNumber

Keep only ONE queue field: dailyQueueNumber


BUSINESS LOGIC IMPLEMENTATION:

1. WHEN NEW BOOKING IS CREATED:
   Step 1: Extract the date from booking time (strip hours/minutes/seconds)
           Example: "2026-02-10 12:39 PM" → "2026-02-10 00:00:00"
   
   Step 2: Count existing bookings for that specific date
           Query: { bookingDate: "2026-02-10 00:00:00" }
           Example result: 5 bookings exist
   
   Step 3: Assign dailyQueueNumber = count + 1
           New booking gets dailyQueueNumber: 6
   
   Step 4: Save booking with:
           {
             name: "customer name",
             phoneNumber: "phone",
             numberOfPeople: 4,
             dailyQueueNumber: 6,
             bookingDate: "2026-02-10 00:00:00",
             bookingDateTime: "2026-02-10 12:39:00 PM",
             status: "waiting",
             createdAt: current timestamp
           }

2. ADMIN PANEL DISPLAY LOGIC:

   ACTIVE QUEUE:
   - Filter: bookingDate equals selected date AND status in ["waiting", "called", "confirmed"]
   - Sort: dailyQueueNumber ascending (1, 2, 3, 4...)
   - Display: Show dailyQueueNumber as "#1", "#2", "#3"
   
   RECENT ACTIVITY:
   - Filter: bookingDate equals selected date AND status equals "completed"
   - Sort: updatedAt descending (latest finished first)
   - Display: Show dailyQueueNumber (must show original number, NOT recalculated)

3. BUTTON ACTIONS:

   CALL NOW button:
   - Update: status = "called", calledAt = current timestamp
   - DO NOT modify: dailyQueueNumber
   
   CONFIRM button:
   - Update: status = "confirmed", respondedAt = current timestamp
   - DO NOT modify: dailyQueueNumber
   
   FINISH button:
   - Update: status = "completed", updatedAt = current timestamp
   - DO NOT modify: dailyQueueNumber
   
   CRITICAL RULE: dailyQueueNumber is PERMANENT and should NEVER be changed after creation

4. DATE FILTER FUNCTIONALITY:
   - When admin selects a date, filter all bookings by bookingDate field
   - Each date has independent queue numbering starting from #1
   - Example:
     * 10 Feb 2026: #1, #2, #3, #4
     * 11 Feb 2026: #1, #2, #3 (restarts from 1)

5. CUSTOMER VIEW (Queue Card):
   - Show: dailyQueueNumber from database
   - Display as: "YOU ARE #4 IN LINE"
   - This number never changes regardless of status


DATABASE MIGRATION REQUIRED:

For existing bookings in database:
1. Add bookingDate field: extract date from createdAt (set time to 00:00:00)
2. Add dailyQueueNumber field: recalculate based on createdAt timestamp per date
3. Remove queueNumber field if exists
4. Remove originalQueueNumber field if exists

Migration Logic:
- Group all bookings by date (from createdAt)
- For each date group, sort by createdAt ascending
- Assign dailyQueueNumber sequentially: 1, 2, 3, 4...


TESTING SCENARIOS TO VERIFY:

Scenario 1: New bookings on same day
- Customer 1 books at 10:00 AM → gets #1
- Customer 2 books at 11:00 AM → gets #2
- Customer 3 books at 12:00 PM → gets #3
✓ Expected: Queue numbers are 1, 2, 3

Scenario 2: Finish button preserves queue number
- Customer #2 is confirmed
- Admin clicks Finish on customer #2
- Customer #2 moves to Recent Activity
✓ Expected: Still shows as #2 in Recent Activity

Scenario 3: Out of order finishing
- Customer #1 is waiting
- Customer #2 is confirmed and finished first
- Customer #3 is confirmed and finished second
✓ Expected: Recent Activity shows #2 and #3 with their original numbers

Scenario 4: Date filter
- Select 10 Feb 2026
✓ Expected: Only shows bookings from 10 Feb, queue numbers start from #1
- Select 11 Feb 2026
✓ Expected: Only shows bookings from 11 Feb, queue numbers start from #1 again


IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST:

Backend:
□ Update Booking schema/model with correct fields
□ Create migration script for existing data
□ Update booking creation logic to assign dailyQueueNumber
□ Ensure status update operations don't modify dailyQueueNumber
□ Update all query filters to use bookingDate field

Frontend:
□ Display dailyQueueNumber in Active Queue
□ Display dailyQueueNumber in Recent Activity
□ Ensure date filter passes bookingDate to backend queries
□ Update customer queue card to show dailyQueueNumber

Please implement this complete restructuring and ensure the queue numbering system works correctly with daily resets and permanent queue numbers.
