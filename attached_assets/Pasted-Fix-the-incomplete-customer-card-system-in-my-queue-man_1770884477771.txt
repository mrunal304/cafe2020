Fix the incomplete customer card system in my queue management application.

CURRENT PROBLEM:
- Customer cards exist but are missing critical fields
- Current customer card structure has only: _id, phoneNumber, name, createdAt, updatedAt, __v
- Missing fields: totalVisits, visits (array), firstVisitDate, lastVisitDate, email
- queueentries already has customerCardId and visitNumber (working)

WHAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED:

1. UPDATE QUEUE JOIN LOGIC:

When creating NEW customer card, include ALL fields:
```javascript
const customerCard = await db.collection('customercards').insertOne({
  phoneNumber: phoneNumber,
  name: name,
  email: null,
  totalVisits: 0,
  visits: [],
  firstVisitDate: new Date(),
  lastVisitDate: new Date(),
  createdAt: new Date(),
  updatedAt: new Date()
});
```

After creating queue entry, UPDATE customer card:
```javascript
// After queue entry is created
await db.collection('customercards').updateOne(
  { _id: customerCard._id },
  {
    $inc: { totalVisits: 1 },
    $push: { visits: queueEntry.insertedId },
    $set: {
      lastVisitDate: new Date(),
      updatedAt: new Date()
    }
  }
);
```

For RETURNING customers:
```javascript
// Calculate visitNumber from existing totalVisits
const visitNumber = customerCard.totalVisits + 1;

// Create queue entry
// Then update customer card (same as above)
```

2. CREATE MIGRATION SCRIPT:

Create file: server/scripts/fixCustomerCards.js

This script should:
- Connect to MongoDB using connection string from environment or config
- Get all customer cards
- For each customer card:
  * Find all queueentries with that customerCardId
  * Count total visits
  * Create visits array with all queue entry IDs
  * Get first and last visit dates
  * Update customer card with these fields:
    - email: null
    - totalVisits: (count)
    - visits: (array of IDs)
    - firstVisitDate: (oldest visit date)
    - lastVisitDate: (newest visit date)
- Log progress for each customer

3. CREATE CUSTOMER API ENDPOINTS:

Create file: server/routes/customers.js

Endpoints needed:

GET /api/customers/:phoneNumber
- Find customer card by phoneNumber
- Get all queueentries for this customer (sorted by date, newest first)
- Return: { success, customer, visits, totalVisits }

GET /api/customers
- Get all customer cards sorted by totalVisits descending
- Return: { success, customers, count }

Register routes in main server file:
```javascript
const customerRoutes = require('./routes/customers');
app.use('/api/customers', customerRoutes);
```

VERIFICATION:
After implementation:
- Customer cards should have 10+ fields (not just 6)
- New bookings should update totalVisits and visits array
- Migration script should fix all existing customer cards
- API endpoints should return customer history

Please implement these fixes to complete the customer card system.
